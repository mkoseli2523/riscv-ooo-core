# riscv-ooo-core

**riscv-ooo-core** is an out-of-order RISC-V processor implemented in SystemVerilog. This project demonstrates key microarchitectural techniques used in modern CPU design, including register renaming, dynamic scheduling, speculative execution, and advanced memory hierarchy optimizations. The processor supports the full RV32IM instruction set and is verified using benchmark programs such as CoreMark and AES/SHA.

The mp_ooo folder includes the full implementation.
